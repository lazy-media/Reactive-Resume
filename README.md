# **🚀 The Moment You've All Been Patiently Not Waiting For**  
The *gloriously* public version of Reactive Resume is now live at **[https://rxresume.lazymedia.media](https://rxresume.lazymedia.media)**!  

No email? No problem! Use a throwaway, your grandma’s AOL address, or just stare at the screen until it lets you in—*your choice*.  

⚠️ **IMPORTANT PSA:**  
- **Remove your resumes from the old app** before **July 15, 2025**, unless you enjoy locked doors and authentication-induced existential dread.  
- Start using the new **email-verification-free paradise** today: [https://rxresume.lazymedia.media](https://rxresume.lazymedia.media)  

---

### **"But What’s the Catch?"** *(Spoiler: There Isn’t One… Probably)*  
- � **Runs on** the *mighty* Nginx Docker Compose stack (because why reinvent the wheel?).  
- ☁️ **Hosted 24/7** in a *~magical~* cloud VM (read: someone’s basement server with extra fans).  
- 💾 **Storage space**: "Plenty"™ (until it’s not—*fingers crossed*).  
- ⏳ **Uptime**: Should be always available, minus daily restarts to check for updates (because even servers need coffee breaks).  
- 🔙 **Backups**: Weekly or monthly… *eventually* (we’re as excited as you are).  
- 📧 **Email**: Optional! Use it only if you *want* to verify or reset passwords (how *novel*).  

---

**Pro Tip:** Don’t thank us—just enjoy your newfound freedom from corporate surveillance disguised as "user verification." 🎉

## Ollama / OpenWebUI Instructions

> The current documentation inside the UI for Reactive Resume is not accurate. Follow these instructions to properly setup Ollama / OpenWebUI for local AI integration.
> _Cannot figure out how to change the UI information without getting an error code or random letters and numbers._

You can integrate with OpenWebUI to use with your local AI. This requires an HTTPS connection.

- 1. Get an API/Access Token from OpenWebUI
- 2. Input the token in the appropriate field.
- 3. Set the OpenWebUI URL as either one of these examples:
  - a) https://openwebui.example.com/api
  - b) https://localhost:8080/api
    - _Make sure to change the port number if yours differs from the default OpenWebUI Port._
- 4. Select your preferred model (e.g., llama3:latest)
- 5. Configure max tokens and other parameters as needed
